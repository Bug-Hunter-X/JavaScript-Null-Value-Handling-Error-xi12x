# JavaScript Null Value Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values. The `bug.js` file contains code with a flaw in null handling. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected version.

The bug involves a function that attempts to add two numbers without properly checking for null values, leading to unexpected results or errors. The solution showcases a simple check to handle these null values gracefully.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (like a browser's console or Node.js).
3. Execute the code in each file to see the difference in the output.
